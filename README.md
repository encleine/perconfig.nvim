# personal nvim config 

my personal config built from kickstart


It's minimal fork but I aimed to keep it simple so besides codeium and the keymaps all the changes are visual  
I also seprated the plugins and configs into their own files just because I think it's easier to manage

# kickstart.nvim 

you should use the original [kick start repo](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) to build your own config
